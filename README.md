# NeonSky Typeface
 [![License: Open Font-1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-OFL_1.1-lightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1)

A [variable font](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) (and a static font family) inspired by the city _Solution Nine_ in _FINAL FANTASY XIV_.

The design of NeonSky features a futuristic and Sci-Fi look.

The font has **two** variable axes:

- **Weight** (100-900): Thin – Black
- **Width** (100-200): Regular – Ultra Expanded

The static font files are generated via interpolation.

> It's my first time doing web development. I feel very shameful that I borrowed a lot of design and script snipet from the [demo page](https://demos.tyfromtheinternet.com/leaguemonovariable/) of [League Mono](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono). I would not be able to make this demo page without this reference. My sincere appreciation here.
