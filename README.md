 ![repo](preview/repo.png)

A [Variable font](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) family inspired by the city _Solution Nine_ in _FINAL FANTASY XIV_.

The design of NeonSky features a geometric, futuristic and Sci-Fi look.

The font has **two** variable axes:

- **Weight** (100-900): Thin – Black
- **Width** (100-200): Regular – Ultra Expanded

and **three** styles:

- Solid
- Stencil
- [Pixel](https://github.com/karaipsum/NeonSky-Font/releases/tag/v1.000-p) (new!!)


The static font files are generated via interpolation.

> It's my first time doing web development. I feel very shameful that I borrowed a lot of design and script snipet from the [demo page](https://demos.tyfromtheinternet.com/leaguemonovariable/) of [League Mono](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono). I would not be able to make this demo page without this reference. My sincere appreciation here.
